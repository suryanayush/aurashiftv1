# AuraShift Development Rules & Guidelines

## 1. Core Development Principles

### 1.1 Code Quality Standards
- **TypeScript First**: All new code must be written in TypeScript with strict type checking
- **Functional Components**: Use React functional components with hooks exclusively
- **Immutable State**: All state updates must be immutable using Redux Toolkit
- **Error Boundaries**: Implement error boundaries for all major feature components
- **Performance**: Optimize for 60fps animations and smooth user interactions

### 1.2 Architecture Patterns
- **Clean Architecture**: Separate business logic from UI components
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access through service layers
- **Dependency Injection**: Use context providers for service dependencies
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component/function should have one clear purpose
- **SOLID Principles**: Follow SOLID design principles throughout the codebase

## 1.3 User Experience Principles
- **Supportive & Non-Judgmental**: Every interaction should encourage and support the user's journey
- **Positive Reinforcement**: Focus on achievements and progress rather than failures
- **Scientific Accuracy**: All health information must be backed by credible sources
- **Accessibility First**: Design for users with disabilities from day one
- **Privacy Focused**: User data privacy and security is paramount
- **Modern & Professional**: Clean, medical-grade UI with consumer-friendly aesthetics

### 1.4 Supportive, Non-Judgmental Experience
- **Rule**: Never shame users for relapses or setbacks
- **Rule**: Always provide encouragement and actionable next steps
- **Rule**: Use "journey" language instead of "failure" language
- **Guideline**: Use positive reinforcement language throughout the app
- **Example**: "Your new journey starts now" instead of "You failed"
- **Example**: "Every moment smoke-free is a victory" instead of "Don't give up"

### 1.5 Scientific Accuracy
- **Rule**: All health claims must be backed by credible medical sources
- **Rule**: Health milestones must reference peer-reviewed research
- **Guideline**: When in doubt, be conservative with health claims
- **Validation**: Medical accuracy review required for health-related content

## 1.6 Storyline & Narrative Rules

### 1.6.1 User Journey Narrative
- **Rule**: Frame the experience as a personal transformation journey, not a restriction
- **Rule**: Use empowering language that positions the user as the hero of their story
- **Rule**: Celebrate small wins as meaningful milestones in their larger story
- **Example**: "You're writing a new chapter" instead of "You're quitting smoking"
- **Example**: "Your wellness journey" instead of "Your quit attempt"

### 1.6.2 Progress Storytelling
- **Rule**: Present data as chapters in their success story
- **Rule**: Use narrative elements to connect past, present, and future progress
- **Rule**: Frame setbacks as plot twists, not endings
- **Guideline**: "Your story so far..." sections in progress views
- **Example**: "In your first week, you've already..." instead of just showing numbers

### 1.6.3 Motivational Messaging
- **Rule**: Messages should feel personal and contextual to user's journey stage
- **Rule**: Use future-focused language that builds anticipation
- **Rule**: Reference user's specific motivations from onboarding
- **Example**: "Your family will see the difference in 2 weeks" (if family was selected as motivation)
- **Example**: "Your skin is already starting to heal" (if appearance was a motivation)

### 1.6.4 Achievement Storytelling
- **Rule**: Frame achievements as story milestones, not just numbers
- **Rule**: Connect achievements to user's personal motivations
- **Rule**: Use celebratory language that acknowledges the difficulty of the journey
- **Example**: "24 hours - Your first chapter is complete!" instead of "24 hour achievement unlocked"
- **Example**: "You've saved $30 - That's a step closer to [user's financial goal]"

### 1.6.5 Contextual Encouragement Rules
- **Rule**: Tailor encouragement based on time of day and user patterns
- **Rule**: Reference user's progress in encouraging messages
- **Rule**: Provide specific, actionable next steps
- **Example**: Morning: "Good morning! You're starting day 8 of your journey strong"
- **Example**: Evening: "Another smoke-free day complete - you're building something amazing"

### 1.6.6 Relapse Recovery Narrative
- **Rule**: Frame relapses as temporary detours, not journey endings
- **Rule**: Immediately redirect focus to the next positive step
- **Rule**: Acknowledge the difficulty without dwelling on the setback
- **Rule**: Reference user's previous progress as proof of capability
- **Example**: "Your journey continues. You've proven you can do this - let's start your next chapter"
- **Example**: "Every expert was once a beginner. Your [previous streak] days showed your strength"

## 2. AuraShift Specific Rules

- **Rule**: Half-hourly notifications (8:30, 9:30, etc.) send message "xyz"
- **Rule**: Notifications must respect user's quiet hours and preferences
- **Rule**: All notifications must be contextual and personalized when possible
- **Guideline**: Use Firebase Cloud Messaging for reliable delivery

### 2.4 Calendar & Activity Logging Rules
- **Rule**: Users can log multiple activities per day
